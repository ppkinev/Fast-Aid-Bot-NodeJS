# Telegram Bot - FastAid

[Link to see it in work](https://t.me/FastAid_bot) - you'll need to have [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) installed in order to use it.

The idea behind this project was to help people do instant actions in emergency situations.
It has more than 25K subscribers in Ukraine only and saved several lives.

## Why?
Not so far before this bot we've built a game in Telegram and Messenger - interactive chat story, which is currently available in appstore as a native app.

To prove the concept I've built it as a bot, a bit later, while iOS developers were working on production version, I used the same technology to build some more bots.
One of them is this. That's why it has some redundant files, like mini-games, for ex.

At the moment we had Node 4 available on the server, so it was done in old fashioned es5 style.
