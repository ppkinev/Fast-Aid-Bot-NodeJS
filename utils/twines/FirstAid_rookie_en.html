-- There are around 50 000 people die yearly before ambulance comes. This number could be way smaller, if injured could get the first aid. We’ve created the project @FastAid_bot to make you prepared for extreme situations.
-- The project was made up by FAST company team, who are specialized in providing first aid training (and other special skills) to companies and individuals - http://www.FirstAid.in.ua/
-- The project was built and published by https://sayhimedia.com/
-- Let's get back to life savings, but start from your own safety.
